# Etch-a-Sketch

## Overview

In the Etch-a-Sketch project of the Foundations Course, I'll dive into the world of DOM manipulation.
This project challenges me to create a browser-based version that captures the essence of a sketchpad combined with the nostalgia of an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Challenge

I should prepare for a journey of learning and exploration. This project is designed to push my boundaries and encourage resourcefulness.
I'll likely find myself turning to online references and experimenting with JavaScript methods and CSS properties.
I should embrace the challenge, as overcoming obstacles is a fundamental part of the learning process.
